# SlicerMorph101
## Introduction to 3D Morphology with 3D Slicer and SlicerMorph

### Course Prerequisites

If you do not already have them, please obtain accounts at:
* https://github.com
* https://morphosource.org
* https://orcid.org.
GitHub and ORCID are mandatory to use MorphoCloud. MorphoSource account is required, if you want to be able to download data (you can search for data without an account). 
  
Also you will **need a 3-button mouse (this is really important)** to operate 3D Slicer effectively. Optionally, I advise installing latest [stable version of 3D Slicer](https://download.slicer.org) on your own computer as a backup, in case you have issues with cloud connections. 

Finally, having a second monitor is advised, since that will allow you to keep your zoom and cloud sessions on separate screens. 

### MorphoCloud On Demand
We will run this course through our cloud platform, MorphoCloud On Demand. Once you obtain the necessary accounts, to go https://instances.morpho.cloud, read the document about how MorphoCloud operates, and then use the provided link to request an instance. It is important that you do this **at least 24h before the course starts** to give enough time that your instance request to be approved, setup properly and for you to have a chance to test it. 
For ideal performance, we suggest using a wired ethernet connection at your university's campus. A dedicated wifi network (like your home) should also work fine. You should avoid public wifi access points due to variable network performance.
