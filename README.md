# SlicerMorph101
## Introduction to 3D Morphology with 3D Slicer and SlicerMorph

### Course Prerequisites

If you do not already have them, please obtain accounts at:
* https://github.com
* https://morphosource.org
* https://orcid.org.
  
GitHub and ORCID are mandatory to use MorphoCloud. MorphoSource account is required, if you want to be able to download data (you can search for data without an account). 
  
Also you will **need a 3-button mouse (cannot emphasize this enough)** to operate 3D Slicer (or any other 3D software) effectively. Optionally, I advise installing latest [stable version of 3D Slicer](https://download.slicer.org) on your own computer as a backup, in case you have issues with cloud connections. 

Finally, having a second monitor is advised, since that will allow you to keep your zoom and cloud sessions on separate screens. 

### MorphoCloud On Demand
We will run this course through our cloud platform, MorphoCloud On Demand. Once you obtain the necessary accounts, to go https://instances.morpho.cloud, read the document about how MorphoCloud operates, and then use the provided link to request an instance. It is important that you do this **at least 24h before the course starts** to give enough time that your instance request to be approved, setup properly and for you to have a chance to test it. 
For ideal performance, we suggest using a wired ethernet connection at your university's campus. A dedicated wifi network (like your home) should also work fine. Please avoid public wifi access points due to unpredictable network performance.  

Some important points about MorphoCloud On Demand sessions:
* Always keep your data in the **MyData** storage volume. This is your persistent storage, data stored elsewhere may get deleted.
* You will have to extend your session approximately every 3.5h after your instance becomes online. Simply click `YES` when the popup window shows up.
* Because the instances automatically shelve itself after 4h (unless you extend it), the next morning you will find your instance is offline. Go to your specific issues page (direct link is in the email sent to you by MorphoCloud earlier), and issue the `/unshelve` command. Based on the load, it may take anywhere from 2-20 minutes for your instance to become online. So make sure you do this before we start the course.
* You can upload data to your instance by dragging and dropping individual files to the browser window. Those files will be saved under your **MyData** volume, which is located at `/media/volumes/MyData/`.
* Use the `CTRL(CMD in Mac) + ALT + SHIFT` combination to make the cloud connection side window visible (or to make it disappear, if visible). From here you can adjust the scaling of your display. As well as download files from the cloud to your computer using the file navigator. It is also possible to copy/paste text to/from the cloud using this interface, though it does take some getting used to.
* For best user experience, switch to full screen mode in your browser window (not advisable if you do not have a second monitor, as you won't be able to see the zoom window).
* For more information see the FAQ at the https://instances.morpho.cloud.
