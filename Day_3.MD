# Day 3

**Recap from Day 2:** Segmentation questions?

* [Review the 3D Slicer segmentation recipes by Andras Lasso](https://lassoan.github.io/SlicerSegmentationRecipes/)
* alternative open source web based 3d viewer for exported models (in glTF format): https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/

* **Markups:** https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/tree/main/Markups_1
* **Surface Toolbox & Dynamic Modeler** https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/tree/main/Slicer_Modules/Surface_Toolbox
* **SlicerANTsPy: Image Registration and atlas building** Sample Data to use is in `/media/share/MorphoCloudCephShare/SlicerMorph101/ANTSamples` folder. We will use these two samples: **129S1_SVLMJ** and **C57BL_J** (and their landmarks) as interactive examples. 

* Saving Scenes, MRB for sharing
* **Open Anatomy Export:** https://github.com/PerkLab/SlicerOpenAnatomy/blob/master/OpenAnatomyExport/README.md
* Sharing Models. 


* Git and Github (if we have time)
