# Day 1 Overview

We will go through the MorphoCloud functionality, Slicer user interface, Extension Manager, documentation and where to find help:

We will review these Slicer and SlicerMorph (in paranthesis) modules:

0. **SampleData:** https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/tree/main/SampleData
1. **ImageStacks (SlicerMorph):** https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/tree/main/ImageStacks#imagestacks
2. **DICOM Module:** https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Spr_2021/blob/main/Day_1/DICOM/DICOM.md
3. **Volumes:** https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Spr_2021/blob/main/Day_1/CropVolume/CropVolume_and_Volumes.md#volumes 
4. **Volume Rendering:** https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Spr_2021/blob/main/Day_2/VolumeRendering/VolumeRendering.md
5. **Crop Volume:** https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Spr_2021/blob/main/Day_1/CropVolume/CropVolume_and_Volumes.md#volumes
5. **Animator (SlicerMorph):** https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/tree/main/Animator

**NOTE:** Remember `/media/share/MorphoCloudCephShare/SlicerMorph101` is where most of the sample data is (the big datasets). This folder is **ReadOnly**. Anything you want to save, write to `/media/volume/MyData`.

**END OF DAY NOTES:** to install the VLC media player (so that you can view mp4s you have created on the cloud), open a terminal window and type the command: 

```sudo apt install vlc```

end then accept the proposed changes. This will be a persistent change, it will stay with you.

I am not sure what I did wrong during the session, but I did manage [to get the Turtle Animation working](./turtle.mp4) 

If you feel like experimenting on your own, I put all requisite files into a folder in the MorphoCloudCephShare (`SlicerMorph101/TurtleAnimationa_Files`)
