## Deep learning based segmentation models in Slicer:

* **TotalSegmentator:** For human clinical imaging
* **DentalSegmentator:** Cone-beam CT for dentistry
* **AutoSeg3d:** Model farm for different clinical modalities. Based on MONAI. https://github.com/lassoan/SlicerMONAIAuto3DSeg/releases/tag/ModelsTestResults
* **MonaiLabel:** A client/server approach for training custom deep-learning models, and making inference from them. https://docs.monai.io/projects/label/en/latest/quickstart.html
* **MEMOS:** E15 mice multi-organ segmentation model. https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMEMOS

## Scripting in Slicer
* Install the `ScriptEditor` extension (to modify the scripts inside the Slicer)
* We will use code snippets from Script Repository (Slicer Developer's guide): https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/script_repository.html

Most of the time, all we have to do is to make sure the file paths are changed to correct spot, and/or make sure the specific objects/nodes (e.g., "F") exists

## If we have time:

* Open Anatomy Export
* Image Registration 
* Model Registration
