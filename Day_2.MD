## Segmentation ##
This is a big tutorial and it is going to have two parts:
1. First we will do a self-paced exercise, and everybody will use the BrainTumor data from the Slicer's SampleData module to do the tutorial as written, which is here: https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/tree/main/Segmentation
3. Review some of the keyboard shortcuts available through SlicerMorph customizations. 
3. Then we will interactively explore the turtle data for more of the segmentation tools in Slicer.

Other modules we will investigate are:
**Segment Statistics:** https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/segmentstatistics.html
**Segment Cross Sectional Area (provided by Sandbox Extension)**
*Models:** https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/models.html
**Textured Models:**
**Colorize Volume (provided by Sandbox extension):** https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/tree/main/ColorizeVolume
**Quick Align:** https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/tree/main/QuickAlign
